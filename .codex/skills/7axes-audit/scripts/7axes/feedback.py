"""
feedback.py — the outer learning loop. Run at the START of each audit (the
orchestrator does this automatically) or ad hoc.

Reads outcomes of previously filed 7axes issues from GitHub and converts
human/agent judgment into calibration updates:

  issue closed as COMPLETED (or a merged PR references it)
      → rule confirmed: rule_stats.confirmed++, finding → resolved in ledger
  issue closed as NOT_PLANNED / labeled false-positive / wontfix
      → rule_stats.rejected++, fingerprint added to suppressed_fingerprints;
        if a rule's precision (confirmed / reported) drops below 0.34 with
        ≥3 reports, the whole rule_id is suppressed and a learned directive
        is written telling that axis's auditor why.

This is the mechanism that makes the system measurably better with use:
precision improves because rejected rules stop consuming attention.
